# GridWalk Web
This is a mini-CSS framework.
Tending to simplify creation of single-webpage with a "grid navigation".

## No prefixed source
For this project, I use the fantastic [prefix-free](leaverou.github.io/prefixfree) by [Lea Verou](lea.verou.me).

## It comes in 2 implementations !
One without JS, and one with Keybinding JS.
